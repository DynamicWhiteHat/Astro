#### Astro is open source! Feel free to contribute to commands by making your own and creating a pull request!

## Major changes from v1:
- Uses a trained intent-based classifier that allows much better command recognition
- Assistant GUI
- New, more natural-sounding text-to-speech engine
- Improved structure that makes it easier to add future commands

## Features:
- Hands-free experience with speech recognition
- AI capability, with the ability to interpret your screen
- Natural language processing allows for varitations in commands
- Natural-sounding text to speech

## Commands:
- "open": Opens an app
- "ask ai...": Asks AI
- "shut down": Shut down with confirmation
- "restart": Restart with confirmation
- "sleep": Sleep
- "close": Closes an app,
- "time": Gets the current time,
- "timer": Sets a timer for *x* hours, *x* minutes, and *x* seconds

## Usage:
.exe file coming soon. For now, clone the repo onto your device, create your own API keys for GROQ and Pixabay (both free) and fill them in for the variables, then run main.py.

## Planned updates:
I plan to add back the offline AI capability and browser functions from v1. I am also currently working on fixing the notes system, which doesn't work most times.

## Legacy
The legacy folder contains Astro v1. Though v1 is much less robust and functional compared to v2, it does have a few more commands than the new version. 

### Legacy commands
- "open": Opens an app
- "ask ai": Asks AI, available both online and offline
- "show": Shows Pixabay images of your request in the browser
- "go to": Goes to the requested website
- "search": Searches for the requested search term
- "shut down": Shut down with confirmation
- "restart": Restart with confirmation
- "sleep": Sleep
- "close": Closes an app,
- "clock": Gets the current time,
- "set timer": Sets a timer,
- "change voice": Changes the voice to Andrew or Evelyn
- "jot": Takes a note of what you say
- "notes": Shows your notes

##### Initially called Styne (after Einstein), the name was changed to Astro after speech recognition difficulties.
